# Evolve List to Target Sum

## Problem Description
# Given a target integer **T** and a fixed list length **k**, evolve a list of # `k` numbers (0–9) whose sum exactly equals **T**.

---

## Input
# - An integer `T` — the target sum.
# - An integer `k` — the number of elements.

---

## Output
# - `k` integers separated by spaces, such that their sum is exactly `T`.

## Examples

### Case 1

**Input:**
# T = 7 k = 2

**Output:**
# 2 5
